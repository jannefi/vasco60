# Photographic Plate Forensics: a practical community library

> **Purpose.** Photographic survey plates are still scientifically valuable, but interpreting *digitised* plate products requires “plate literacy”: knowledge of PSF structure, photographic/emulsion artefacts, and digitisation/copying effects.
>
> This library collects **practical controls**, **diagnostic ideas**, and **hard-to-find references** so that discussions about plate-based anomalies can converge on reproducible checks rather than folklore.

## What this library is (and is not)
- **Is:** a curated set of references + reproducible “minimum viable controls” for evaluating plate-based anomalies.
- **Is not:** a claim about any single phenomenon; it aims to help *separate hypotheses* (optics/emulsion/digitisation vs astrophysical).

## Where the data come from (common sources)
- **Digitized Sky Survey (DSS):** digitised Schmidt survey plates distributed by STScI/MAST and mirrored elsewhere (DSS1/DSS2).  
- **APPLAUSE:** a modern digitisation + calibration archive with extracted source tables and metadata.  
- **MAPS/APS (POSS‑I):** digitised POSS‑I catalogues with computed image parameters and classification outputs.

## Minimum viable controls (MVC) for “anomalous” detections
1. **Cross-scanner / cross-digitisation provenance:** confirm presence/absence across independent scans (e.g., DSS vs SuperCOSMOS where available).
2. **Local PSF comparison:** compare candidate FWHM/shape/radial profile against *nearby stars of similar brightness*.
3. **Plate-position stratification:** check whether effects change with distance from plate centre / annular bins (focus/field effects).
4. **Edge buffers:** repeat analyses excluding plate edges/corners to reduce vignetting and processing artefact concentration.

## Common mechanism families (cheat sheet)
### A) Optics + PSF structure
- Gaussian-like cores plus non-Gaussian wings/scattered-light “aureoles”.
- Internal reflections, halation, ghost images.

### B) Photographic/emulsion + processing
- Development-related adjacency effects; local processing non-uniformities (“local errors”).
- Sensitivity to sky/background estimation at faint levels.

### C) Digitisation + copying procedures
- Scanner-dependent morphology differences.
- Copying/atlas reproduction artefacts (where relevant to the dataset).

## Diagnostics (quick plots and sanity checks)
- **Width vs shape departure:** candidate FWHM relative to local-star median vs a shape/departure metric.
- **Two-population check:** cluster in (width, shape) space, then inspect cutouts for each cluster.
- **Confidence regime awareness:** contour metrics on tiny areas can be unstable; stratify by confidence/area.
